In this example, we have a Burger class that represents a burger with its components (patty, bun, veggies, and sauce). The __str__ method is overridden to provide a nice string representation of the burger.

The BurgerBuilder class is a separate class that provides methods to build a Burger instance step by step. It has methods like add_patty, add_bun, add_veggies, and add_sauce that allow you to specify the components of the burger. The build method creates and returns a Burger instance with the specified components.

To create a burger, you instantiate a BurgerBuilder, call the appropriate add_* methods to specify the components, and then call the build method to get the final Burger instance.

For example, to create a veggie burger, you do:

`
veggie_burger_builder = BurgerBuilder()
veggie_burger = veggie_burger_builder.add_patty("Veggie patty") \
                                     .add_bun("Sesame seed bun") \
                                     .add_veggies("Lettuce, tomato, onion") \
                                     .add_sauce("Vegan mayo") \
                                     .build()
                                     `

This Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object (like a burger) from its representation, allowing you to create different representations using the same construction process.

The benefit of this approach is that you can create different burger variations by reusing the BurgerBuilder class and calling the appropriate add_* methods. It also provides a fluent interface for building burgers, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.
